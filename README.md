## Features

This project involves a simple responsive application in the calculation of BMI and its table. Mobx was used in its construction. I am aware that 'setState' would be sufficient and there was no need to use such a powerful state manager for something so simple, but here is an example that even in simple tasks it is a powerful tool. The application was run on an Android device and on the Web (Chrome) in order to test its responsiveness.
